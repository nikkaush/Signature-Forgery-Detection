# Signature-Forgery-Detection

Implemented supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to perform offline signature forgery detections.
Supervised learning relies on the Siamese Network model, implemented using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and Triplet Loss.
Unsupervised learning approach performs k-means clustering on the pixels.
